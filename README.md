##Overview of the Project

### project: PASSWORD STRENGTH CHECKER

### Objective
The objective of this project is to perform the strength of passwords entered by users. Implement algorithms to analyze factors such as length, complexity, and uniqueness to provide feedback on password strength.

###Key Activities
-**Length**
Longer passwords are generally harder to crack. As a rule of thumb, a minimum length of 8â€“12 characters is often recommended, with higher scores for longer passwords.
-**Comlexity**
A strong password typically includes a mix of character types:
Uppercase letters (A-Z)
Lowercase letters (a-z)
Numbers (0-9)
Special characters (!, @, #, etc.)
-**Uniqueness**
Simple, common words (e.g., "password," "hello") and predictable patterns (e.g., "12345," "qwerty") weaken a password.
-**Feedback**
Based on the score, provide real-time feedback such as:
"Weak: Consider adding more characters and mixing character types."
"Moderate: Good length, but try using special characters."
"Strong: Your password is secure."
